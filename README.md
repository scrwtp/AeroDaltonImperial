==================

A Robocode robot that I wrote for a tournament we held at work.

It uses [Guess Factor Targeting](http://robowiki.net/wiki/GuessFactor_Targeting) for the gun and a combination of [Anti-Gravity Movement](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Anti-Gravity_Movement) and Radius Sampling (a point-generation based method) for movement.

As it was my first experience with Robocode and the first robot I wrote, I learned the ropes as I went along. Even though I didn't win the tournament, it performed quite decent in the end.
There are still some things worth working out in the code:
* a proper target selection mechanism for melee,
* pattern matching gun that I didn't implement in the end,
* a few parameters need refining to get the bullet dodging mechanism working.
I might get back to it if I'll have time to spare or we'll be having another edition of the tournament.
